--Sample script to generate file name for ranges in vss backup instead of range buffer
-- create database.
create database test;
GO

use test;
GO
-- create a table such that each row is on a page
create table tab
	(ID INT IDENTITY NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	 BIGSTRING VARCHAR(7996)
	 );
declare @dml NVARCHAR(300); --for query
declare @RowCount int; -- RowCount iterator
set @RowCount = 0;
set @dml = 'INSERT INTO tab(BIGSTRING) VALUES(REPLICATE(''a'', 7996));'

--Max row count we need to insert, 150k rows gives us close to 65kb buffer
--using below updates, I have kept it 200k which gives 98kb buffer, anything above
--64 kb will give us filename instead of range values.

declare @MaxRowCount int;
set @MaxRowCount = 200000;

--Insert the rows

while @RowCount < @MaxRowCount

begin
       exec(@dml);
       set @RowCount = @RowCount + 1;
end

-- TAKE THE FULL BACKUP HERE, We use betest.exe here.
--BETEST.EXE /B /E /T FULL /S backupdoc_full.txt /D c:\tools\sqlbetest\backup\full /C comp1_file.txt

-- here we update the rows I re-declared the variables as I executed it as separate script
-- I am updating every 17th row so, we update alternate extent, which will make range buffer big.

declare @dml NVARCHAR(300);
declare @RowCount int;
declare @MaxRowCount int;
set @MaxRowCount = 200000;
set @RowCount = 1;

while @RowCount < @MaxRowCount
begin
       set @dml = 'UPDATE tab set BIGSTRING = REPLICATE(''b'', 7996) where ID = ' + cast(@RowCount as varchar(10)) + ';';
       exec(@dml);
       set @RowCount = @RowCount + 16;
