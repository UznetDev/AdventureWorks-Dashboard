Description:
    1. First step is to use Lending Club CSV files and import them into an in-memory staging table
    2. Second step is to transform the staging data and move them into the table which will be used for the predictions

#>
# Get a list of all the CSV files in the folder
$files = ls C:\Tiger\Extract\*.csv # TODO: Change the path to the appropriate location of the CSV files


# Create a function to import the CSV data by skipping the first line
# You will see a number of Invoke-SqlCmd failures for rows that are not being imported into the database
function ImportData ($csvFile)
{


    $SqlServer = "." # TODO: Change the name of SQL Server instance name
    $dbName = "LendingClub" # TODO: Change the name of the database
    $csvData = Get-Content -Path $csvFile | Select-Object -Skip 1 | Where-Object {$_.id -notcontains "*Total amount funded in policy code*"} | ConvertFrom-Csv
