# SQL Server In-memory

In-Memory OLTP can significantly improve OLTP database application performance. It is a memory-optimized database engine integrated into the SQL Server engine, optimized for OLTP. With In-Memory OLTP you can increase the transaction throughput by up to 30 times, depending on the specifics of the workload. The performance gains come from:
  - Tables use memory-optimized data structures and data access methods.
  - Core transaction processing is completely free of locks.
  - Natively compiled modules execute Transact-SQL statements more efficiently.
