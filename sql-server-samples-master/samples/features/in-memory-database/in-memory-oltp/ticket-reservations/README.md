# In-Memory OLTP Performance Improvement Sample

This Windows Forms sample application built on .NET Framework 4.6  demonstrates the performance benefits of using SQL Server memory optimized tables and native compiled stored procedures. You can compare the performance before and after enabling In-Memory OLTP by observing the transactions/sec as well as the current CPU Usage and latches/sec.

The demo is run in this [17-minute video explaining In-Memory OLTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5l5eophmK4) (demo is at 8:25).

## Running this sample
1. Before you can run this sample, you must have the following perquisites:
	- SQL Server 2014 (or higher)
	- Visual Studio 2015 (or higher) with the latest SSDT installed.

2. Clone this repository using Git for Windows (http://www.git-scm.com/), or download the zip file.

3. From Visual Studio, open the **InMemoryOLTPDemo.sln** file from the root directory.

4. In Visual Studio Build menu, select **Build Solution** (or Press F6).

5. In the **App.config** file, located in the project root, find the **TicketReservations** app setting and edit the connectionString if needed. Currently it is configured to connect to the local default SQL Server Instance using Integrated Security.

6. Publish the TicketReservations Database
  - Right click on the TicketReservations SQL Server Database Project and Select **Publish**
  - Click Edit... to choose your connection string
  - Click Publish
  - Note: For publishing to Azure SQL you need to change the DB project target platform to **Microsoft Azure SQL Database V12**

7. Build the app for release and run it. Do not use the debugger, as that will slow down the app.

8. Start the workload with the **Start** button, and run for a while to show perf profile. Then press stop to stop the workload. You can tweak aspects of the workload (e.g., rows per transaction) through the configuration form accessed using the "Options" menue.

9. In the database project,
	- Change TicketReservationDetail.sql to a memory-optimized table (instructions commented in the file itself)
	- Change InsertReservationDetails.sql to natively compiled (instructions in the same file)

10. Publish the database project to the same database – the tool will take care of making the necessary changes.
		Note that, as part of publication, the data is copied from the old disk-based table to the new memory-optimized table, so the longer you run the initial workload, the longer this publication takes. To speed up the process you can run `TRUNCATE TABLE dbo.TicketReservationDetail` in the database.

11. Go back to the app and run the workload again. No need to recompile or restart the application.

The perf gains from In-Memory OLTP as shown by the load generation app depend on two factors:\

- Hardware
    - more cores => higher perf gain
    - slower log IO => lower perf gain
- Configuration settings in the load generator
    - more rows per transaction => higher perf gain
    - more reads per write => lower perf gain
    - default setting is 100 rows per transaction and 1 read per write

If the performance profile after migration to In-Memory OLTP looks choppy, it is likely that log IO is the bottleneck. This can be mitigated by using [delayed durability](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn449490.aspx). This is enabled by running the following statement in the database:
	`ALTER DATABASE CURRENT SET DELAYED_DURABILITY = FORCED`

With default settings on one machine with 24 logical cores and relatively slow SSD for the log the app shows around performance 40X gain, and in this case the bottleneck was log IO. Note that the factor gain can vary with the hardware being used.

When deploying to Azure SQL Database, make sure to run the app in an Azure VM in the same region as the database.

If you have a beefy machine and are seeing a drop-off in transaction throughput after running the demo for a while, increase the BUCKET_COUNT in 'TicketReservations/dbo/Tables/TicketReservationDetail.sql' by a factor of 10 or 100.
