                "TempDB metadata contention has historically been a bottleneck to scalability for many workloads running on SQL Server. SQL Server 2019 introduces a new feature that is part of the [In-Memory Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/in-memory-database) feature family, memory-optimized tempdb metadata, which effectively removes this bottleneck and unlocks a new level of scalability for tempdb-heavy workloads. In SQL Server 2019, the system tables involved in managing temp table metadata can be moved into latch-free non-durable memory-optimized tables.\r\n",
