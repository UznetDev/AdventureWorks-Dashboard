Failure to do so will lead to poor query performance. Most applications should have these options ON. When the Auto Update Statistics setting is ON, the Query Optimizer updates statistics when they are used by a query and when they might be out-of-date. Statistics become out-of-date after insert, update, delete, or merge operations change the data distribution in the table or indexed view. The Query Optimizer determines when statistics might be out-of-date by counting the number of data modifications since the last statistics update and comparing the number of modifications to a threshold. The threshold is based on the number of rows in the table or indexed view. The Query Optimizer checks for out-of-date statistics before compiling a query and before executing a cached query plan. Before compiling a query, the Query Optimizer uses the columns, tables, and indexed views in the query predicate to determine which statistics might be out-of-date. Before executing a cached query plan, the Database Engine verifies that the query plan references up-to-date statistics. The AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS option applies to statistics created for indexes, single-columns in query predicates, and statistics that are created by using the CREATE STATISTICS statement.

The size or number of virtual log files cannot be configured or set by administrators. If the log files grow to a large size in many small increments, they will have many virtual log files. This can slow down database startup and also log backup and restore operations. Conversely, if the log files are set to a large size with few or just one increment, they will have few very large virtual log files.

Failure to do so will lead to poor query performance. Most applications should have these options ON. When the Auto Update Statistics setting is ON, the Query Optimizer updates statistics when they are used by a query and when they might be out-of-date. Statistics become out-of-date after insert, update, delete, or merge operations change the data distribution in the table or indexed view. The Query Optimizer determines when statistics might be out-of-date by counting the number of data modifications since the last statistics update and comparing the number of modifications to a threshold. The threshold is based on the number of rows in the table or indexed view. The Query Optimizer checks for out-of-date statistics before compiling a query and before executing a cached query plan. Before compiling a query, the Query Optimizer uses the columns, tables, and indexed views in the query predicate to determine which statistics might be out-of-date. Before executing a cached query plan, the Database Engine verifies that the query plan references up-to-date statistics.

Latches are used to synchronize access to cached data pages and other in-memory objects. Typically, latches are only held briefly, and latch wait times should be correspondingly small. A high number for this counter means that many processes are waiting for latch classes that are not related to buffers which, depending on the latch class, could affect your workload.","https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/diagnose-resolve-latch-contention","Server","Windows Linux",,"SqlServer, ManagedInstance","[11.0,)",,"500",

SQL Server creates a work file in tempdb when the amount of data being processed is too big to fit into the available memory used for hash operations, and generates a hash warning as a result. Determine the queries that are generating hash warnings using Extended Events.To eliminate or reduce the frequency of hash recursion and bailouts, do one of the following: Make sure that statistics exist on the columns that are being joined or grouped. If statistics exist on the columns, make sure that these are updated. Tune the query to use a different type of join, namely by adding appropriate indexes. Increase available memory on the computer. Hash recursion or bailout occurs when there is not enough memory to process queries in place and they need to spill to disk. Creating or updating the statistics on the column involved in the join is the most effective way to reduce the number of hash recursion or bailouts that occur, namely when appropriate indexes are already in place.","https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/event-classes/hash-warning-event-class","Server","Windows Linux",,"SqlServer, ManagedInstance","[11.0,)",,"0.2",
