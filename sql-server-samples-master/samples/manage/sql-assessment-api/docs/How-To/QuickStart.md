# SQL Assessment API Quick Start Guide

Assess your SQL Server configuration in 2 simple steps.

## 1. Setup

Install the [PowerShell SqlServer module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SqlServer) using the following command.

```PowerShell
Install-Module -Name SqlServer -AllowClobber
```

## 2. Invoke assessment

To invoke an assessment against a local SQL Server instance, run the following command.

```PowerShell
Get-SqlInstance -ServerInstance 'localhost' | Invoke-SqlAssessment
```

Sample result:

```PowerShell
PS:> Get-SqlInstance -ServerInstance localhost | Invoke-SqlAssessment

   TargetPath: Server[@Name='LOCAL']

Sev. Message                                                            Check ID              Origin

```

In the results, you will see that each rule has some properties (not the full list):

- Severity (info, low, medium, high)
- Message property explains the recommendation but if you need more info, there is a HelpLink property that points at documentation on the subject.
- Origin shows which ruleset and version the recommendation is coming from

See [ruleset.json](./ruleset.json) for a full list of rules and properties.

If you want to get recommendations for all databases on the local instance, run this command.

```PowerShell
Get-SqlDatabase -ServerInstance 'localhost' | Invoke-SqlAssessment
```
