# Automatic variables

Data for assessment is delivered by probes. Some data is available before the first probe is invoked, e.g. target SQL Server version or requirements for probes. This data might be accessed via automatic variables.

Automatic variables are grouped in namespaces.

- [attr::service::](./AttrService.md)
