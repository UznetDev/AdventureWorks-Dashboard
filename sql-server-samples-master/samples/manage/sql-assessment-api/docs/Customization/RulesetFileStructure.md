# Ruleset file structure

Rule set is stored in a text file that contains a JSON object. The rule set object has three simple mandatory properties: `name`, `version`, and `schemaVersion`. The latter specifies the file format version. As of the time of writing this document, the file format version is 1.0. The `name` and `version` properties comprise the identity of the set.

An essential part of a ruleset is the optional `rules` property that stores an array of SQL Assessment API rules. Rules are used to build a checklist. For more information, see [Understanding Rules and Probes](./RulesandProbes.md).

The optional `probes` property contains definitions for probes. Probes are used to get actual data from target SQL Server instances, hosting machines, and other sources. Each probe definition is a JSON array of one or more implementations. For more information, see [Probes](../Reference/Probes/README.md).

The `rules` and `probes` properties are optional because rules from one ruleset can use probes from another one.
