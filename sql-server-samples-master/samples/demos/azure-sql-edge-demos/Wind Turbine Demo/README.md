# Azure SQL Edge Demo

## Overview

The Azure SQL Edge demo is based on a Contoso Renewable Energy, a wind turbine farm that leverages Azure SQL Edge for data processing onboard the generator.

The demo will walk you through resolving an alert being raised due to wind turbulence being detected at the device. You will train a model and deploy it to SQL DB Edge that will correct the detected wind wake and ultimately optimize power output.

We will also look at some of the security features available with Azure SQL Edge.

## Wind Turbine Data Explanation for the Wake Detection model

The data stored in the database table represents the following:


* **RecordId:** _Unique identifier for the entry._
* **TurbineId:** _Unique identifier for the turbine in scope._
* **GearboxOilLevel:** _Oil level recorded for the turbine gear box at the time of the reading._
* **GearboxOilTemp:** _Oil temperature recorded for the turbine gear box at the time of the reading._
* **GeneratorActivePower:** _Active Power recorded by the turbine generator._
* **GeneratorSpeed:** _Speed recorded by the turbine generator._
* **GeneratorTemp:** _Temperature recorded by the turbine generator._
* **GeneratorTorque:** _Torque recorded by the turbine generator._
* **GridFrequency:** _Frequency recorded in the grid for the specific wind turbine._
* **GridVoltage:** _Voltage recorded in the grid for the specific wind turbine._
* **HydraulicOilPressure:** _Current pressure of the hydraulic oil for the wind turbine._
* **NacelleAngle:** _Angle of the nacelle at the time of the reading (the housing that contains all the generating components)._
* **PitchAngle:** _Pitch angle of the blades against the oncoming air stream to obtain the optimal amount of energy._
* **Vibration:** _Vibration of the wind turbine at the time of the reading._
* **WindSpeedAverage:** _Average wind speed calculated from the last X records._
* **Precipitation:** _Flag to represent if rain was present at the time of the reading._
* **WindTempAverage:** _Average wind temperature calculated from the last X records._
* **OverallWindDirection:** _Overall wind direction recorded at the time of the reading._
* **TurbineWindDirection:** _Turbine wind direction recorded at the time of the reading._
* **TurbineSpeedAverage:** _Average turbine speed calculated from the last X records._
* **WindSpeedStdDev:** _Standard Deviation of the last X WindSpeedAverage records._
* **TurbineSpeedStdDev:**  _Standard Deviation of the last X TurbineSpeedAverage records._

The above dataset definition contains trends that will enable us to detect the existence of wake in a wind turbine. There are two main conditions that influence the presence of wind wake:

1.	Overall wind farm and turbine wind direction are both between 40° - 45° degrees.
1.	TurbineSpeedStdDev and WindSpeedStdDev have been too far apart for greater than a minute.

The wind turbine will experience wake when the turbine wind direction is between 40° - 45° degrees and the values of TurbineSpeedStdDev and WindSpeedStdDev are not similar. For example:
* Wake Present:
    * TurbineWindDirection = 43.5°
    * TurbineSpeedStdDev = 8.231
    * WindSpeedStdDev = 0.23
* Wake Not Present:
    * TurbineWindDirection = 23.5°
    * TurbineSpeedStdDev = 0.921
    * WindSpeedStdDev = 0.213



## Azure Resource Deployment

An Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template will be used to deploy all the required resources in the solution.  Click on the link below to start the deployment.

[![homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fzarmada.blob.core.windows.net%2Farm-deployments-public%2Farm-template-dbedge.json "Deploy template")

TODO ^^ Need to update the ARM location

### Deployment of resources

Follow the steps to deploy the required Azure resources:

**BASICS**

   - **Subscription**: Select the Subscription.
   - **Resource group**:  Click on 'Create new' and provide a unique name for the Resource Group
   - **Location**: Select the Region where to deploy the resources. Keep in mind that all resources will be deployed to this region so make sure it supports all of the required services. The template has been confirmed to work in West US 2.

1. Read and accept the `TERMS AND CONDITIONS` by checking the box.
1. Click the `Purchase` button and wait for the deployment to finish.

## Post Deployment Configuration

Some resources require some extra configuration.

#### Upload SQL DACPAC

The Edge Module will require access the DACPAC package in order to setup the database.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) select the **Resource Group** you created earlier.
1. Select the **Storage account** resource from the list.
1. Click the **Containers** option in the left menu under **Blob service**.
1. Click the **dacpac** container.
1. Click the **Upload** button.
1. Click the **Select a file** input and select the file under the project folder: `sql/turbine-sensor-db-dacpac.zip`.
1. Click the **Upload** button.
1. Once the file is uploaded, click on it.
1. Click **Generate SAS** tab.
1. Update the **Expiry** year to 2050.
1. Click **Generate SAS token and URL**
1. Copy the value in **Blob SAS URL** and save it for later in the setup.


##### SQL Security Setup Information

As security settings were deployed as part of the DACPAC package, below is a **review** of the security setup within the database.

1. Create users without a login for simpler testing:
    ```sql
    /* Create users using the logins created */
    CREATE USER OperatorUser WITHOUT LOGIN;
    CREATE USER DataScientistUser WITHOUT LOGIN;
    CREATE USER SecurityUser WITHOUT LOGIN;
    CREATE USER TurbineUser WITHOUT LOGIN;
    ```

1. Assigned permissions for each user:
    ```sql
    /* Grant permissions to users */
    GRANT SELECT ON RealtimeSensorRecord TO OperatorUser;
    GRANT SELECT ON RealtimeSensorRecord TO DataScientistUser;
    GRANT SELECT ON RealtimeSensorRecord TO SecurityUser;
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON RealtimeSensorRecord TO TurbineUser;
    ```
    > **Note**: All users can SELECT, however the TurbineUser can also INSERT to the table.

1. For privacy reasons, mask the last 4 digits of the SensorId for the Data Scientist user:
    ```sql
    /*Mask the last four digits of the serial number (Sensor ID) for the Data Scientist User*/
    ALTER TABLE RealtimeSensorRecord
    ALTER COLUMN SensorId varchar(50) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'partial(34,"XXXX",0)');
    DENY UNMASK TO DataScientistUser;
    GO
    ```

1. Add a policy using a filter predicate and a function to manage access to data events:
    *  We updated the SensorType column as it is required in our function then created a new schema to store it.

        ```sql
        /**
        * Operator: Can see all events
        * Data Scientist: Can see everything BUT Hatch Sensor events
        * Security: Can ONLY see Hatch Sensor events
        */
        ALTER TABLE RealtimeSensorRecord
        ALTER COLUMN SensorType sysname
        GO

        CREATE SCHEMA Security;
        GO
        ```
    *  Add the function that will ensure each query is authorized based on Sensor Type/User.


        ```sql
        /**
        * Operator: Can see all events
        * Data Scientist: Can see everything BUT Hatch Sensor events
        * Security: Can ONLY see Hatch Sensor events
        */
        CREATE FUNCTION Security.fn_securitypredicate(@SensorType AS sysname)
        RETURNS TABLE
        WITH SCHEMABINDING
        AS
        RETURN SELECT 1 AS fn_securitypredicate_result
            WHERE
                USER_NAME() = 'OperatorUser' OR USER_NAME() = 'dbo' OR
                (USER_NAME() = 'DataScientistUser' AND @SensorType <> 'HatchSensor') OR
                (USER_NAME() = 'SecurityUser' AND @SensorType = 'HatchSensor');
        ```
    * Add a filter to to use the function.


        ```sql
        CREATE SECURITY POLICY SensorsDataFilter
        ADD FILTER PREDICATE Security.fn_securitypredicate(SensorType)
        ON dbo.RealtimeSensorRecord
        WITH (STATE = ON);
        ```

1. Click the **Save** button.
1. Go back to the **Web App** and refresh.
1. After a short time the alert will appear again.

# Optional Steps

This section describe steps that allow us to see extra features of the resources as a reference only.

## Device VM access

Here we will see how to run commands into to the device virtual machine from the terminal using SSH connection.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) select the **Resource Group** you created earlier.
2. Select the **Virtual machine** resource.
3. Copy the **DNS name** to use it for the connection.
4. In a terminal run the following command replacing the **DNS name**:` ssh microsoft@<DNS_Name>`
    > **Note**: The above command is assuming that you use the default Admin username when deploying the VM.

5. Enter the password to connect.
    > **Note**: Default password is: `M1cr0s0ft2020`

6. Run the following command to see the list of modules running: `sudo iotedge list`
    > **Note**: You can should be able to see the `AzureSQLDatabaseEdge` and `SensorModule` we deployed earlier.

7. Run the following command to see the logs of the **Sensor Module**: `sudo iotedge logs SensorModule`
    *   Following we will connect with the edge sql server to run a simple query by doing:
        * Get the list of containers running with docker: `sudo docker container list`.
        * Get the container ID of the `AzureSQLDatabaseEdge` docker image running.
        * Connect to the container using the id that you got and the command: `sudo docker exec -it CONTAINERID /bin/sh`.
        * Connect to the container using: `/opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'Microsoft2020$'`.
        * Connect to the database using: `USE [turbine-sensor-db]` and then `go`.
        * Query the number of records in the table using: `select count(*) from RealtimeSensorRecord` and `go`.

# Troubleshooting
### Error when deploying ARM Template
We've seen issues with different subscription types: MSDN, AIRS, etc... not being able to deploy certain resources to certain regions.  We've found that deploying to West US 2 works consistently.  If you have a deployment error, try deploying to West US 2.  The resources inherit their deployment region from the Resource Group location.
